                        <p>Once you've made an account and logged in, you can select 8 rikishi from the top two divisions for your team.</p>
                        <p>Pick one rikishi for each of these ranks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sanyaku</li>
                            <li>Sanyaku</li>
                            <li>M1-M4</li>
                            <li>M5-M8</li>
